## Library

Relational Operations

## Description

Performs element-wise less than or equal relational operation on the
inputs. The block returns true (1) if the first input is less than or
equal to the second input; returns false (0) otherwise.

## Data Type Support

The Lesser Equals block supports inputs of native data types of MATLABÂ®
and Ap_Fixed data type supported by Vitis HLS. The output type is always
Boolean. It does not support complex data types. The block supports
inputs of scalar, vector, and matrix dimensions. When both inputs have
non-scalar dimensions then the dimensions of the inputs must match each
other.

## Parameters

The Lesser Equals block has no parameters to set.
