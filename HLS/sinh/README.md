## Data Type Support

Data type support is:

- Dimension: Input can be scalar, vector or matrix.
- Data Types: Input supports signals of integer type, floating-point
  data types (double, single, and half) and fixed-point type.
- Complex Numbers: Complex numbers are not supported.

The output has the same dimension and data type as the input.

## Parameters

The sinh block has no parameters to set.
