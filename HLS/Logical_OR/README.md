a Boolean result on the output.

## Data Type Support

- The Logical OR block supports all data types supported by Model
  Composer.
- The block supports inputs of different data types. The output data
  type is always Boolean.
- The block only supports real inputs.
- The block supports scalar and non-scalar type inputs. If one input is
  non-scalar type then the other input can be scalar type. When both
  inputs are non-scalar type then their dimensions must match. In that
  case, the output has the same dimension as the inputs.

## Parameters

The Logical OR block has no parameters to set.
