# Matrix Multiply

Compute matrix product of two input signals. The first operand is the
top input on the block.

## Description

The Matrix Multiply block has two input ports and one output port. The
output signal is the matrix product of the input signals where the first
operand corresponds to the top input.

## Data Type Support

The data type of the input signals can be any floating-point,
fixed-point, integer, or Boolean. The input signals can be real or
complex. The input signals can be scalar, vector, or matrix, but they do
need to be such that mathematically, the matrix product is defined. The
table below shows valid combinations. Combinations that do not match any
row in the table result in an error.

| Dimensions of First Operand | Dimensions of Second Operand | Dimensions of Matrix Product | Conditions                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| K x L                       | L x M                        | K x M                        | K \>= 1, L \>= 1, M \>= 1 |
| K x L                       | L                            | K                            | K \>= 1, L \> 1           |
| K x 1                       | 1                            | K x 1                        | K \>= 1                   |
| K                           | 1                            | K                            | K \>= 1                   |
| K                           | 1 x M                        | K x M                        | K \>= 1, M \>= 1          |

The output data type is determined according to the following rules, in
the order listed. T1 is a variable representing the type of the first
operand; T2 is a variable representing the type of the second operand.
These rules were chosen for maximum alignment with Vitis HLS, which may
not correspond to the output data type computed via the internal rule of
the SimulinkÂ® Matrix Product block.
