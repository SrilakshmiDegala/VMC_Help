## Data Type Support

Data type support is:

- Input Data Type: All data types are supported except unsigned integer
  and Boolean values.
- Output: The data type, dimension, and complexity of the output are
  the same as those of the input signal.

The block supports scalar, vector, and two-dimensional matrix data.

## Parameters

The Negate block has no parameters to set.
