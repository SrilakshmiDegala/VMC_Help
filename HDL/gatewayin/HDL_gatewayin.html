<p>The Xilinx Gateway In blocks are the inputs into the HDL portion of
your Simulink® design. These blocks convert Simulink® integer, double,
and fixed-point data types into the Model Composer fixed-point type.
Each block defines a top-level input port or interface in the HDL design
generated by Model Composer.</p>

<h2 id="conversion-of-simulink-data-to-model-composer-data">Conversion
of Simulink Data to Model Composer Data</h2>
<p>A number of different Simulink data types are supported on the input
of Gateway In. The data types supported include int8, uint8, int16,
uint16, in32, uint32, single, double, and Simulink fixed point data type
(if Simulink fixed point data type license is available). In all causes
the input data is converted to a double internal to gateway and then
converted to target data type as specified on the Gateway In block
(Fixed Point, Floating Point or Boolean). When converting to Fixed point
from the internal double representation, the Quantization and Overflow
is further handled as specified in the Block GUI. For overflow, the
options are to saturate to the largest positive/smallest negative value,
to wrap (for example, to discard bits to the left of the most
significant representable bit), or to flag an overflow as a Simulink
error during simulation. For quantization, the options are to round to
the nearest representable value (or to the value furthest from zero if
there are two equidistant nearest representable values), or to truncate
(for example, to discard bits to the right of the least significant
representable bit).It is important to realize that conversion, overflow
and quantization do not take place in hardware, they take place only in
the simulation model of the block.</p>
<h2 id="gateway-blocks">Gateway Blocks</h2>
<p>As listed below, the Xilinx Gateway In block is used to provide a
number of functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converting data from Simulink integer, double and fixed-point type
to the Model Composer fixed-point type during simulation in
Simulink.</li>
<li>Defining top-level input ports or interface in the HDL design
generated by Model Composer.</li>
<li>Defining test bench stimuli when the Create Testbench box is checked
in the System Generator token. In this case, during HDL code generation,
the inputs to the block that occur during Simulink simulation are logged
as a logic vector in a data file. During HDL simulation, an entity that
is inserted in the top level test bench checks this vector and the
corresponding vectors produced by Gateway Out blocks against expected
results.</li>
<li>Naming the corresponding port in the top level HDL entity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="block-parameters">Block Parameters</h2>
<p>The Block Parameters dialog box can be invoked by double-clicking the
icon in your Simulink model.</p>
<p>Basic tab<br />
Parameters specific to the Basic tab are as follows. Output Type<br />
Specifies the output data type. Can be Boolean, Fixed-point, or
Floating-point.</p>
<p>Arithmetic Type<br />
If the Output Type is specified as Fixed-point, you can select Signed
(2’s comp) or Unsigned as the Arithmetic Type.</p>
<p>Fixed-point Precision<br />
Number of bits<br />
Specifies the total number of bits, including the binary point bit
width.</p>
<p>Binary point<br />
Specifies the bit location of the binary point, where bit zero is the
least significant bit.</p>
<p>Floating-point Precision<br />
Single<br />
Specifies single precision (32 bits).</p>
<p>Double<br />
Specifies double precision (64 bits).</p>
<p>Custom<br />
Activates the field below so you can specify the Exponent width and the
Fraction width.</p>
<p>Exponent width<br />
Specify the exponent width.</p>
<p>Fraction width<br />
Specify the fraction width.</p>
<p>Quantization<br />
Quantization errors occur when the number of fractional bits is
insufficient to represent the fractional portion of a value. The options
are to Truncate (for example, to discard bits to the right of the least
significant representable bit), or to Round(unbiased: +/- inf) or Round
(unbiased: even values).</p>
<p>Round(unbiased: +/- inf)<br />
Also known as &quot;Symmetric Round (towards +/- inf)&quot; or &quot;Symmetric Round
(away from zero)&quot;. This is similar to the MATLAB® <code>round()</code>
function. This method rounds the value to the nearest desired bit away
from zero and when there is a value at the midpoint between two possible
rounded values, the one with the larger magnitude is selected. For
example, to round 01.0110 to a Fix_4_2, this yields 01.10, since 01.0110
is exactly between 01.01 and 01.10, and the latter is further from
zero.</p>
<p>Overflow<br />
Overflow errors occur when a value lies outside the representable range.
For overflow the options are to Saturate to the largest
positive/smallest negative value, to Wrap (for example, to discard bits
to the left of the most significant representable bit), or to Flag as
error (an overflow as a Simulink® error) during simulation. Flag as
error is a simulation only feature. The hardware generated is the same
as when Wrap is selected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Implementation tab<br />
Parameters specific to the Implementation tab are as follows. Interface
Options<br />
Interface<br />
None<br />
Implies that during HDL Netlist generation, this Gateway In will be
translated as an Input Port at the top level.</p>
<p>AXI4-Lite<br />
Implies that during HDL Netlist generation, an AXI4-Lite interface will
be created and this Gateway In will be mapped to one of the registers
within the AXI4-Lite interface.</p>
<p>Auto assign address offset<br />
If the Gateway In is configured to be an AXI4-Lite interface, this
option allows an address offset to be automatically assigned to the
register within the AXI4-Lite interface that the Gateway In is mapped
to.</p>
<p>Address offset<br />
If Auto assign address offset is not checked, then this entry box allows
you to explicitly specify an address offset to use. Must be a multiple
of 4.</p>
<p>Interface Name<br />
If the Gateway In is configured to be an AX4-Lite interface, assigns a
unique name to this interface. This name can be used to differentiate
between multiple AXI4-Lite interfaces in the design. When using the IP
Catalog flow, you can expect to see an interface in the IP that Model
Composer creates with the name
&lt;design_name&gt;_&lt;interface_name&gt;_ s_axi.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: The Interface Name must be composed of alphanumeric
characters (lowercase alphabetic) or an underscore (_) only, and must
begin with a lowercase alphabetic character. axi4_lite1 is acceptable,
1Axi4-Lite is not.</p>
<p>Description<br />
Additional designer comments about this Gateway In that is captured in
the interface documentation.</p>
<p>Constraints<br />
IOB Timing Constraint<br />
In hardware, a Gateway In is realized as a set of input/output buffers
(IOBs). There are two constraint options: None, and Data Rate.</p>
<p>If None is selected, no timing constraints for the IOBs are put in
the user constraint file produced by Model Composer. This means the
paths from the IOBs to synchronous elements are not constrained.</p>
<p>If Data Rate is selected, the IOBs are constrained at the data rate
at which the IOBs operate. The rate is determined by System Clock Period
provided on the System Generator token and the sample rate of the
Gateway relative to the other sample periods in the design.</p>
<p>Specify IOB location constraints<br />
Checking this option allows IOB location constraints and I/O standards
to be specified.</p>
<p>IOB pad locations, e.g. {&#39;MSB&#39;, ..., &#39;LSB&#39;}<br />
IOB pin locations can be specified as a cell array of strings in this
edit box. The locations are package-specific.</p>
<p>IO Standards, e.g. {&#39;MSB&#39;, ..., &#39;LSB&#39;}<br />
I/O standards can be specified as a cell array of strings in this edit
box. The locations are package-specific.</p>
