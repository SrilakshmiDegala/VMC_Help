# Vector Real Gateway In

The Vector Real Gateway In block converts vector inputs of type
Simulink® integer, single, double, and fixed-point to Xilinx®
fixed-point or floating-point data type.

Hardware notes: In hardware, these blocks become top level input ports.

## Description

Super Sample Rate (SSR): This configurable GUI parameter is primarily
used to control processing of multiple data samples on every sample
period. This block enables 1-D vector support for the primary block
operation.

The Vector Real Gateway In blocks are the inputs into the HDL portion of
your Simulink design. These blocks convert Simulink integer, double and
fixed-point data types into the Model Composer fixed-point type. Each
block defines a top-level input port or interface in the HDL design
generated by Model Composer.

## Conversion of Simulink Data to Model Composer Data

A number of different Simulink data types are supported on the input of
Vector Real Gateway In. The data types supported include int8, uint8,
int16, uint16, in32, uint32, single, double, and Simulink fixed-point
data type(if Simulink fixed-point data type license is available). In
all causes the input data is converted to a double internal to gateway,
and then converted to target data type as specified on the Vector Real
Gateway In block (Fixed-point, Floating-point or Boolean). When
converting to Fixed-point from the internal double representation, the
Quantization, and Overflow is further handled as specified in the Block
GUI. For overflow, the options are to saturate to the largest
positive/smallest negative value, to wrap (for example, to discard bits
to the left of the most significant representable bit), or to flag an
overflow as a Simulink error during simulation. For quantization, the
options are to round to the nearest representable value (or to the value
furthest from zero if there are two equidistant nearest representable
values), or to truncate (for example, to discard bits to the right of
the least significant representable bit). It is important to realize
that conversion, overflow and quantization do not take place in
hardware. They take place only in the simulation model of the block.

## Gateway Blocks

As listed below, the Xilinx Vector Real Gateway In block is used to
provide a number of functions:

- Converting data from Simulink integer, double, and fixed-point type to
  the Model Composer fixed-point type during simulation in Simulink.
- Defining top-level input ports or interface in the HDL design
  generated by Model Composer.
- Defining test bench stimuli when the Create Testbench box is checked
  in the System Generator token. In this case, during HDL code
  generation, the inputs to the block that occur during Simulink
  simulation are logged as a logic vector in a data file. During HDL
  simulation, an entity that is inserted in the top level test bench
  checks this vector, and the corresponding vectors produced by Vector
  Real Gateway Out blocks against expected results.
- Naming the corresponding port in the top level HDL entity.

## Block Parameters

Open the Block Parameters dialog box double-clicking the icon in your
Simulink model.

Basic Tab  
Parameters specific to the Basic tab are as follows:

Output Type  
Specifies the output data type. Can be Boolean, Fixed-point, or
Floating-point.

Arithmetic Type  
If the Output Type is specified as Fixed-point, you can select Signed
(2’s comp) or Unsigned as the Arithmetic Type.

Fixed-point Precision  
Number of bits  
Specifies the bit location of the binary point, where bit zero is the
least significant bit.

Binary point  
Specifies the bit location of the binary point, where bit zero is the
least significant bit.

Floating-point Precision  
Single  
Specifies single precision (32 bits).

Double  
Specifies double precision (64 bits).

Custom  
Activates the field below so you can specify the Exponent width and the
Fraction width.

Exponent width  
Specify the exponent width.

Fraction width  
Specify the fraction width.

Quantization  
Quantization errors occur when the number of fractional bits is
insufficient to represent the fractional portion of a value. The options
are to Truncate (for example, to discard bits to the right of the least
significant representable bit), or to Round(unbiased: +/- inf) or Round
(unbiased: even values).

Round(unbiased: +/- inf) also known as "Symmetric Round (towards +/-
inf)" or "Symmetric Round (away from zero)". This is similar to the
MATLAB `round()` function. This method rounds the value to the nearest
desired bit away from zero and when there is a value at the midpoint
between two possible rounded values, the one with the larger magnitude
is selected. For example, to round 01.0110 to a Fix_4_2, this yields
01.10, since 01.0110 is exactly between 01.01 and 01.10 and the latter
is further from zero.

Overflow  
Overflow errors occur when a value lies outside the representable range.
For overflow the options are to Saturate to the largest
positive/smallest negative value, to Wrap (for example, to discard bits
to the left of the most significant representable bit), or to Flag as
error (an overflow as a Simulink error) during simulation. Flag as error
is a simulation only feature. The hardware generated is the same as when
Wrap is selected.

Implementation Tab  
Parameters specific to the Implementation tab are as follows:

Interface Options  
Interface  
None  
Implies that during HDL Netlist generation, this Vector Real Gateway In
is translated as an Input Port at the top level.

AXI4-Lite  
Implies that during HDL Netlist generation, an AXI4-Lite interface will
be created, and this Vector Real Gateway In is mapped to one of the
registers within the AXI4-Lite interface.

Auto assign address offset  
If the Vector Real Gateway In is configured to be an AXI4-Lite
interface, this option allows an address offset to be automatically
assigned to the register within the AXI4-Lite interface that the Vector
Real Gateway In is mapped to.

Address offset  
If Auto assign address offset is not checked, then this entry box allows
you to explicitly specify an address offset to use. Must be a multiple
of 4.

Interface Name  
If the Vector Real Gateway In is configured to be an AX4-Lite interface,
assigns a unique name to this interface. This name can be used to
differentiate between multiple AXI4-Lite interfaces in the design. When
using the IP catalog flow, you can expect to see an interface in the IP
that Model Composer creates with the name
`<design_name>_<interface_name>_ s_axi`.

IMPORTANT: The Interface Name must be composed of alphanumeric
characters (lowercase alphabetic) or an underscore (\_) only, and must
begin with a lowercase alphabetic character. axi4_lite1 is acceptable,
1AXI4-Lite is not.

Description  
Additional designer comments about this Vector Real Gateway In that is
captured in the interface documentation.

Constraints  
IOB Timing Constraint  
In hardware, a Vector Real Gateway In is realized as a set of
input/output buffers (IOBs). There are three ways to constrain the
timing on IOBs. They are: None, Data Rate, and Data Rate, Set 'FAST'
Attribute.

- If None is selected, no timing constraints for the IOBs are put in the
  user constraint file produced by Model Composer. This means the paths
  from the IOBs to synchronous elements are not constrained.
- If Data Rate is selected, the IOBs are constrained at the data rate at
  which the IOBs operate. The rate is determined by System Clock Period
  provided on the System Generator token and the sample rate of the
  Gateway relative to the other sample periods in the design.
- If Data Rate, Set 'FAST' Attribute is selected, the constraints
  described above are produced. In addition, a FAST slew rate attribute
  is generated for each IOB. This reduces delay but increases noise and
  power consumption.

Specify IOB location constraints  
Checking this option allows IOB location constraints and I/O standards
to be specified.

IOB pad locations, e.g. {'MSB', ..., 'LSB'}  
IOB pin locations can be specified as a cell array of strings in this
edit box. The locations are package-specific.IO Standards, e.g. {'MSB',
..., 'LSB'}

IO Standards, e.g. {'MSB', ..., 'LSB'}  
I/O standards can be specified as a cell array of strings in this edit
box. The locations are package-specific.
