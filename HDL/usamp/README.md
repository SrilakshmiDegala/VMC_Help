# Up Sample

The Up Sample block increases the sample rate at the point where
the block is placed in your design. The output sample period is l/n,
where l is the input sample period, and n is the sampling rate.

## Description

The input signal is up sampled so that within an input sample frame, an
input sample is either presented at the output n times if samples are
copied, or presented once with (n-1) zeroes interspersed if zero padding
is used.

In hardware, the Up Sample block has two possible implementations. If
the Copy Samples option is selected on the block parameters dialog box,
the Din port is connected directly to Dout and no hardware is expended.
Alternatively, if zero padding is selected, a mux is used to switch
between the input sample and inserted zeros. The corresponding circuit
for the zero padding Up Sample block is shown below.

### Block Interface

The Up Sample block receives two clock enable signals, Src_CE and
Dest_CE. Src_CE is the clock enable signal corresponding to the input
data stream rate. Dest_CE is the faster clock enable, corresponding to
the output data stream rate. Notice that the circuit uses a single
flip-flop in addition to the mux. The flip-flop is used to adjust the
timing of Src_CE, so that the mux switches to the data input sample at
the start of the input sample period, and switches to the constant zero
after the first input sample. It is important to notice that the circuit
has a combinational path from Din to Dout. As a result, an Up Sample
block configured to zero pad should be followed by a register whenever
possible.

## Parameters


### Basic tab  
Parameters specific to the Basic tab are as follows.
#### Sampling rate (number of output samples per input sample)  
Must be an integer with a value of 2 or greater. This is the ratio of
the output sample period to the input, and is essentially a sample rate
multiplier. For example, a ratio of 2 indicates a doubling of the input
sample rate. If a non-integer ratio is desired, the Up Sample block can
be used in combination with the Down Sample block.

#### Copy samples (otherwise zeros are inserted)  
Allows you to choose what to do with the additional samples produced by
the increased clock rate. By selecting Copy Samples, the same sample is
duplicated (copied) during the extra sample times. If this checkbox is
not selected, the additional samples are zero.

#### Provide enable port  
When checked, this option adds an en (enable) input port, if the Latency
is specified as a positive integer greater than zero.

#### Latency  
This defines the number of sample periods by which the block's output is
delayed. One sample period can correspond to multiple clock cycles in
the corresponding FPGA implementation (for example, when the hardware is
over-clocked with respect to the SimulinkÂ® model). The user defined
sample latency is handled in the Up Sample block by placing shift
registers that are clock enabled at the input sample rate, on the input
of the block. The behavior of an Upsample block with non-zero latency is
similar to putting a delay block, with equivalent latency, at the input
of an Upsample block with zero latency.

Parameters used by this block are explained in the topic [Common Options
in Block Parameter Dialog
Boxes](../../GEN/common-options/README.md).
