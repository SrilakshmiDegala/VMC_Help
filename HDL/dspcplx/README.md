# DSPCPLX

The Xilinx DSPCPLX block is one of the advanced features provided by
VersalÂ® architecture DSP, which is the optimized solution to deal with
18x18 complex multiplication followed by 58 + 58 accumulation operation.

![](./Images/block.png)

Versal architecture DSP supports an 18-bit complex multiplier with two
back-to-back DSP58s in the same tile pair together. The two DSP58s with
their DSP_MODE attributes set to CINT18 form one complex arithmetic
unit. The right DSP58 computes the real result P_RE and left computes
the imaginary result P_IM. The following figure shows the unisim DSPCPLX
primitive which is used to develop this feature.
