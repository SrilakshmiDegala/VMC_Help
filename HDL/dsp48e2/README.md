# DSP48E2

![](./Images/block.png)

The DSP48E2 block is an efficient building block for DSP
applications that use UltraScale devices. DSP applications use many
binary multipliers and accumulators that are best implemented in
dedicated DSP resources. UltraScale devices have many dedicated
low-power DSP slices, combining high speed with small size while
retaining system design flexibility.

## Description

The DSP48E2 slice is effectively a superset of the DSP48E1 slice with
these differences:

- Wider functionality
- More flexibility in the pre-adder
- Added fourth operand to ALU with WMUX
- Wide XOR of the X, Y, and Z multiplexers
- Additional unique features

Refer to the document titled UltraScale Architecture DSP Slice User
Guide
[(UG579)](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/user_guides/ug579-ultrascale-dsp.pdf)
for a detailed description of the DSP48E2 features.

## Parameters

### Basic tab  
Parameters specific to the Basic tab are as follows.

#### Input configuration  
* #### A or ACIN input  
  Specifies if the A input should be taken directly from the a port or
from the cascaded acin port. The acin port can only be connected to
another DSP48 block.

* #### B or BCIN input  
  Specifies if the B input should be taken directly from the b port or
from the cascaded bcin port. The bcin port can only be connected to
another DSP48 block.

  **Note**: If the input to the block is NaN, you will see a behavioral
simulation mismatch.

#### DSP48E2 data-path configuration  
* #### SIMD Mode of Adder/Subtractor/Accumulator  
  This mode can be used to implement small add-subtract functions at high
speed and lower power with less logic utilization. The adder and
subtractor in the adder/subtracted/logic unit can also be split into two
24-bit units or four 12-bit units.

* #### Do not use multiplier  
  When selected, the block is optimized in hardware for maximum
performance without using the multiplier. If an instruction using the
multiplier is encountered in simulation, an error is reported.

* #### Use dynamic multiplier mode  
  When selected, it instructs the block to use the dynamic multiplier
mode. This indicates that the block is switching between A\*B and A:B
operations on the fly and therefore needs to get the worst-case timing
of the two paths.

#### Preadder configuration  
Use the 25-bit D data input to the pre-adder or alternative input to the
multiplier. The pre-adder implements D + A as determined by the INMODE3
signal.

* #### PREADDINSEL Select preadder input  
  Selects the input to be added with D in the preadder.

* #### AMULTSEL Select A multiplexer output  
  Selects the input to the 27-bit A input of the multiplier. In the 7
series primitive DSP48E1 the attribute is called USE_DPORT, but has been
renamed due to new pre-adder flexibility enhancements (default AMULTSEL
= A is equivalent to USE_DPORT=FALSE).

* #### BMULTSEL Select B multiplexer output  
  Selects the input to the 18-bit B input of the multiplier.

* #### Enable D Port  
  Automatically enabled when AD is selected above.

#### Pattern Detection  
* #### Reset p register on pattern detection  
  If selected and the pattern is detected, reset the p register on the
next cycle.

* #### AUTO RESET PRIORITY  
  When enabled by selecting the option above, select RESET (the default)
or CEP (clock enabled for the P (output) resister).

#### Pattern Input  
* #### Pattern Input from c port  
  When selected, the pattern used in pattern detection is read from the c
port.

* #### Using Pattern Attribute (48bit hex value)  
  Value is used in pattern detection logic which is best described as an
equality check on the output of the adder/subtractor/logic unit.

* #### Pattern Attribute (48bit hex value)  
  Enter a 48-bit value that is used in the pattern detector.

#### Mask Input  
* #### Mask input from c port  
  When selected, the mask used in pattern detection is read from the c
port.

* #### Using Mask Attribute (48 bit hex value)  
  Enter a 48-bit value used to mask out certain bits during pattern
detection.

* #### MODE1  
  Selects rounding_mode 1 (C-bar left shifted by 1).

* #### MODE2  
  Selects rounding_mode 2 (C-bar left shifted by 2).

### Wide Xor tab  
Parameters specific to the Wide Xor tab are as follows.

#### Use Wide XOR  
* This is a new feature in the DSP48E2 slice giving the ability to perform
a 96-bit wide XOR function.

#### XORSIMD Select Wide XOR SIMD  
* The XORSIMD attribute is used to select the width of the XOR function.
Select either XOR12 (the default), XOR24, XOR48, or XOR96.

### Optional Ports tab  
Parameters specific to the Optional Ports tab are as follows.

#### Input Ports  
* #### Consolidate control port  
  When selected, combines the opmode, alumode, carry_in,
carry_in_sel, and inmode ports into one 20-bit port. Bits 0 to 6 are
the opmode, bits 7 to 10 are the alumode port, bit 11 is the
carry_in port, bits 12 to 14 are the carry_in_sel port, and bits
15-19 are the inmode bits. This option should be used when the Opmode
block is used to generate a DSP48 instruction.

* #### Provide c port  
  When selected, the c port is made available. Otherwise, the c port is
tied to '0'.

* #### Provide global reset port  
  When selected, the port rst is made available. This port is connected to
all available reset ports based on the pipeline selections.

  When selected, the optional en port is made available. This port is
connected to all available enable ports based on the pipeline
selections.

#### Cascadable Ports  
* #### Provide pcin port  
  When selected, the pcin port is exposed. The pcin port must be

#### Output Ports  
* #### Provide carryout port  
  When selected, the carryout output port is made available. When the
mode of operation for the adder/subtractor is set to one 48-bit adder,
the carryout port is 1-bit wide. When the mode of operation is set to
two 24 bit adders, the carryout port is 2 bits wide. The MSB
corresponds to the second adder's carryout and the LSB corresponds to
the first adder's carryout. When the mode of operation is set to four 12
bit adders, the carryout port is 4 bits wide with the bits
corresponding to the addition of the 48 bit input split into 4 12-bit
sections.

  When selected, the pattern bar detection (patternbdetect) output port is
provided. When the inverse of the pattern, either from the mask or the c
register, is matched the pattern bar detection port is set to '1'.

* #### Provide overflow port  
  When selected, the overflow output port is provided. This port indicates
when the operation in the DSP48E has overflowed beyond the bit P\[N\]
where N is between 1 and 46. N is determined by the number of 1s in the
mask whether set by the GUI mask field or the c port input.

* #### Provide underflow port  
  When selected, the underflow output port is provided. This port
indicates when the operation in the DSP48E has underflowed. Underflow
occurs when the number goes below â€“P\[N\] where N is determined by the
number of 1s in the mask whether set by the GUI mask field or the c port
input.
