# Vector Real Gateway Out

The Vector Real Gateway Out block converts Xilinx® fixed-point or
floating-point type vector inputs into vector outputs of type Simulink®
integer, single, double, or fixed-point.

Hardware notes: In hardware these blocks become top level output ports
or are discarded depending on how they are configured.

## Description

Vector Real Gateway Out blocks are the outputs from the HDL portion of
your Simulink design. This block converts the Model Composer fixed-point
or floating-point data type into a Simulink integer, single, double, or
fixed-point data type.

According to its configuration, the Vector Real Gateway Out block can
either define an output port for the top level of the HDL design
generated by Model Composer, or be used simply as a test point that is
trimmed from the hardware representation

### Gateway Blocks

As listed below, the Vector Real Gateway Out block is used to provide
the following functions:

- Convert data from a Model Composer fixed-point or floating-point data
  type into a Simulink integer, single, double, or fixed-point data
  type.
- Define I/O ports for the top level of the HDL design generated by
  Model Composer. A Vector Real Gateway Out block defines a top-level
  output port.
- Define test bench result vectors when the Model Composer Create
  Testbench box is checked. In this case, during HDL code generation,
  the outputs from the block that occur during Simulink simulation are
  logged as logic vectors in a data file. For each top level port, an
  HDL component is inserted in the top-level test bench that checks this
  vector against expected results during HDL simulation.
- Name the corresponding output port on the top-level HDL entity.

## Parameters

### Basic Tab  
Parameters specific to the Basic tab are as follows.
#### Propagate data type to output  
This option is useful when you instantiate a Model Composer design as a
sub-system into a Simulink design. Instead of using a Simulink double as
the output data type by default, the Model Composer data type is
propagated to an appropriate Simulink data type according to the
following table:

| Model Composer Data Type                                                                                               | Simulink Data Type                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| XFloat_8_24                                                                                                            | single                                   |
| XFloat_11_53                                                                                                           | double                                   |
| Custom floating-point precision data type exponent width and fraction width less than those for single precision       | single                                   |
| Custom floating-point precision data type with exponent width or fraction width greater than that for single precision | double                                   |
| XFix\_\<width\>\_\<binpt\>                                                                                             | sfix\<width\>\_EN\<binpt\>               |
| UFix\_\<width\>\_\<binpt\>                                                                                             | ufix\<width\>\_EN\<binpt\>               |
| XFix\_\<width\>\_0 where width is 8, 16 or 32                                                                          | int\<width\> where width is 8, 16 or 32  |
| UFix\_\<width\>\_0 where width is 8, 16 or 32                                                                          | uint\<width\> where width is 8, 16 or 32 |
| XFix\_\<width\>\_0 where width is other than 8, 16 or 32                                                               | sfix\<width\>                            |
| UFix\_\<width\>\_0 where width is other than 8, 16 or 32                                                               | ufix\<width\>                            |



#### Translate into Output Port  
Having this box unchecked prevents the gateway from becoming an actual
output port when translated into hardware. This checkbox is on by
default, enabling the output port. When this option is not selected, the
Vector Real Gateway Out block is used only during debugging, where its
purpose is to communicate with Simulink Sink blocks for probing portions
of the design. In this case, the Vector Real Gateway Out block turns
gray in color, indicating that the gateway will not be translated into
an output port.

#### Super Sample Rate (SSR)
This configurable GUI parameter is primarily
used to control processing of multiple data samples on every sample
period. This blocks enable 1-D vector support for the primary block
operation.

### Implementation Tab  
Parameters specific to the Implementation tab are as follows.

#### Interface Options  
##### None  
During HDL Netlist generation, this Vector Real Gateway Out will be
translated as an Output Port at the top level.

##### AXI4-Lite  
During HDL Netlist Generation, an AXI4-Lite interface will be created,
and the Vector Real Gateway Out will be mapped to one of the registers
within the AXI4-Lite interface.

##### Interrupt  
During an IP catalog Generation, this Vector Real Gateway Out is tagged
as an Interrupt output port when the Model Composer design is packaged
into an IP module that can be included in the Vivado® IP catalog.

#### Auto assign address offset  
If a Vector Real Gateway Out is configured to be an AXI4-Lite interface,
this option allows an address offset to be automatically assigned to the
register within the AXI4-Lite interface that the Vector Real Gateway Out
is mapped to.

#### Address offset  
If Auto assign address offset is not checked, then this entry box allows
you to explicitly specify a address offset to use. Must be a multiple of
4.

#### Interface Name  
If the Vector Real Gateway Out is configured to be an AX4-Lite
interface, assigns a unique name to this interface. This name can be
used to differentiate between multiple AXI4-Lite interfaces in the
design. When using the IP catalog flow, you can expect to see an
interface in the IP that Model Composer creates with the name
<design_name>_<interface_name>_ s_axi.

**IMPORTANT**: The Interface Name must be composed of alphanumeric
characters (lowercase alphabetic) or an underscore (\_) only, and must
begin with a lowercase alphabetic character. axi4_lite1 is acceptable,
1AXI4-Lite is not.

#### Description  
Additional designer comments about this Vector Real Gateway Out that is
captured in the interface documentation.

### Constraints  
### IOB Timing Constraint  
In hardware, a Vector Real Gateway Out is realized as a set of
input/output buffers (IOBs). There are three ways to constrain the
timing on IOBs. They are None, Data Rate, and Data Rate, Set 'FAST'
Attribute.

#### None  
No timing constraints for the IOBs are put in the user constraint file
produced by Model Composer. This means the paths from the IOBs to
synchronous elements are not constrained.

#### Data Rate  
The IOBs are constrained at the data rate that the IOBs operate. The
rate is determined by System Clock Period provided on the System
Generator token and the sample rate of the Gateway relative to the other
sample periods in the design. For example, the following OFFSET = OUT
constraints are generated for a Vector Real Gateway Out named 'Dout'
that is running at the system period of 10 ns:

``` pre
# Offset out constraints 
NET "Dout(0)" OFFSET = OUT : 10.0 : AFTER "clk"; 
NET "Dout(1)" OFFSET = OUT : 10.0 : AFTER "clk"; 
NET "Dout(2)" OFFSET = OUT : 10.0 : AFTER "clk";
```

##### Specify IOB Location Constraints  
Checking this option allows IOB location constraints to be specified.

##### IOB Pad Locations, e.g. {'MSB', ..., 'LSB'}  
IOB pin locations can be specified as a cell array of strings in this
edit box. The locations are package-specific.

#### Data Rate, Set 'FAST' Attribute  
The OFFSET = OUT constraints described above are produced. In addition,
a FAST slew rate attribute is generated for each IOB. This reduces delay
but increases noise and power consumption. For the previous example, the
following additional attributes are added to the constraints file.

``` pre
NET "Dout(0)" FAST; 
NET "Dout(1)" FAST; 
NET "Dout(2)" FAST; 
```

Other parameters used by this block are explained in the topic [Common
Options in Block Parameter Dialog
Boxes](../../GEN/common-options/README.md).
