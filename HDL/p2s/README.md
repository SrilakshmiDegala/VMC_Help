# Parallel to Serial

The Parallel to Serial block takes an input word and splits it into N
time-multiplexed output words where N is the ratio of number of input
bits to output bits. The order of the output can be either least
significant bit first or most significant bit first.

The following waveform illustrates the block's behavior:

This example illustrates the case where the input width is 4, output
word size is 1, and the block is configured to output the most
significant word first.

## Block Interface

The Parallel to Serial block has one input and one output port. The
input port can be any size. The output port size is indicated on the
Block Parameters dialog box.

## Block Parameters

The block parameters dialog box can be invoked by double-clicking the
icon in your SimulinkÂ® model.
