# Gateway Out

Gateway Out blocks are the outputs from the HDL portion of your
Simulink® design. 

![](./Images/block.png)

## Description
This block converts the Model Composer fixed-point or
floating-point data type into a Simulink integer, single, double or
fixed-point data type.
According to its configuration, the Gateway Out block can either define
an output port for the top level of the HDL design generated by Model
Composer, or be used simply as a test point that is trimmed from the
hardware representation

### Gateway Blocks

As listed below, the Xilinx Gateway Out block is used to provide the
following functions:

- Convert data from a Model Composer fixed-point or floating-point data
  type into a Simulink integer, single, double, or fixed-point data
  type.
- Define I/O ports for the top level of the HDL design generated by
  Model Composer. A Gateway Out block defines a top-level output port.
- Define test bench result vectors when the Model Composer Create
  Testbench box is checked. In this case, during HDL code generation,
  the outputs from the block that occur during Simulink simulation are
  logged as logic vectors in a data file. For each top level port, an
  HDL component is inserted in the top-level test bench that checks this
  vector against expected results during HDL simulation.
- Name the corresponding output port on the top-level HDL entity.

## Parameters

###  Basic tab  
Parameters specific to the Basic tab are as follows.

#### Propagate data type to output  
> This option is useful when you instantiate a Model Composer design as a
sub-system into a Simulink design. Instead of using a Simulink double as
the output data type by default, the Model Composer data type is
propagated to an appropriate Simulink data type according to the
following table:

| Model Composer Data Type                                                                                               | Simulink Data Type                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| XFloat_8_24                                                                                                            | single                                   |
| XFloat_11_53                                                                                                           | double                                   |
| Custom floating-point precision data type exponent width and fraction width less than those for single precision       | single                                   |
| Custom floating-point precision data type with exponent width or fraction width greater than that for single precision | double                                   |
| XFix\_\<width\>\_\<binpt\>                                                                                             | sfix\<width\>\_EN\<binpt\>               |
| UFix\_\<width\>\_\<binpt\>                                                                                             | ufix\<width\>\_EN\<binpt\>               |
| XFix\_\<width\>\_0 where width is 8, 16 or 32                                                                          | int\<width\> where width is 8, 16 or 32  |
| UFix\_\<width\>\_0 where width is 8, 16 or 32                                                                          | uint\<width\> where width is 8, 16 or 32 |
| XFix\_\<width\>\_0 where width is other than 8, 16 or 32                                                               | sfix\<width\>                            |
| UFix\_\<width\>\_0 where width is other than 8, 16 or 32                                                               | ufix\<width\>                            |


#### Translate into Output Port  
> Having this box unchecked prevents the gateway from becoming an actual
output port when translated into hardware. This checkbox is on by
default, enabling the output port. When this option is not selected, the
Gateway Out block is used only during debugging, where its purpose is to
communicate with Simulink Sink blocks for probing portions of the
design. In this case, the Gateway Out block will turn gray in color,
indicating that the gateway will not be translated into an output port.


### Implementation tab  
Parameters specific to the Implementation tab are as follows.

#### Interface Options  
* #### Interface  
  * #### None  
    During HDL Netlist generation, this Gateway Out will be translated as an
Output Port at the top level.

  * #### AXI4-Lite  
    During HDL Netlist Generation, an AXI4-Lite interface will be created
and the Gateway Out will be mapped to one of the registers within the
AXI4-Lite interface.

  * #### Interrupt  
    During an IP Catalog Generation, this Gateway Out will be tagged as an
Interrupt output port when the Model Composer design is packaged into an
IP module that can be included in the Vivado® IP catalog.

  * #### Auto assign address offset  
    If a Gateway Out is configured to be an AXI4-Lite interface, this option
allows an address offset to be automatically assigned to the register
within the AXI4-Lite interface that the Gateway Out is mapped to.

  * #### Address offset  
    If Auto assign address offset is not checked, then this entry box allows
you to explicitly specify a address offset to use. Must be a multiple of 4.

  * #### Interface Name  
    If the Gateway Out is configured to be an AXI4-Lite interface, assigns a
unique name to this interface. This name can be used to differentiate
between multiple AXI4-Lite interfaces in the design. When using the IP
Catalog flow, you can expect to see an interface in the IP that Model
Composer creates with the name \<design_name\>\_\<interface_name\>\_
s_axi.

    **IMPORTANT**: The Interface Name must be composed of alphanumeric
characters (lowercase alphabetic) or an underscore (\_) only, and must
begin with a lowercase alphabetic character. axi4_lite1 is acceptable,
1Axi4-Lite is not.

  * #### Description  
    Additional designer comments about this Gateway Out that is captured in
the interface documentation.

#### Constraints  
* #### IOB Timing Constraint  
  In hardware, a Gateway Out is realized as a set of input/output buffers
(IOBs). There are three ways to constrain the timing on IOBs. They are
None, Data Rate, and Data Rate, Set 'FAST' Attribute.

  If None is selected, no timing constraints for the IOBs are put in the
user constraint file produced by Model Composer. This means the paths
from the IOBs to synchronous elements are not constrained.

  If Data Rate is selected, the IOBs are constrained at the data rate at
which the IOBs operate. The rate is determined by System Clock Period
provided on the System Generator token and the sample rate of the
Gateway relative to the other sample periods in the design. For example,
the following OFFSET = OUT constraints are generated for a Gateway Out
named 'Dout' that is running at the system period of 10 ns:


``` 
# Offset out constraints 
NET "Dout(0)" OFFSET = OUT : 10.0 : AFTER "clk"; 
NET "Dout(1)" OFFSET = OUT : 10.0 : AFTER "clk"; 
NET "Dout(2)" OFFSET = OUT : 10.0 : AFTER "clk";
  ```


> If Data Rate, Set 'FAST' Attribute is selected, the OFFSET = OUT
constraints described above are produced. In addition, a FAST slew rate
attribute is generated for each IOB. This reduces delay but increases
noise and power consumption. For the previous example, the following
additional attributes are added to the constraints file.

  ``` pre
NET "Dout(0)" FAST; 
NET "Dout(1)" FAST; 
NET "Dout(2)" FAST; 
  ```

* #### Specify IOB Location Constraints  
  Checking this option allows IOB location constraints to be specified.

* #### IOB Pad Locations, e.g. {'MSB', ..., 'LSB'}  
  IOB pin locations can be specified as a cell array of strings in this
edit box. The locations are package-specific.

Other parameters used by this block are explained in the topic [Common
Options in Block Parameter Dialog
Boxes](common-options-in-block-parameter-dialog-boxes-aa1032308.html).
